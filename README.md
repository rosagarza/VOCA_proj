# VOCA_proj

## Environment setup/Installation Packages
In order to run the project, we found it best to create a conda environment. You must also get VOCA running by referring to https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca which you will also need to refer to https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh in order to install a necessary package known as psbody mesh. For psbody mesh, it was difficult, but be sure to download the latest release for your OS and if it's MAC, be sure to have your Python version correspond to what's provided wihin the name of the release (ex: psbody_mesh-0.4-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl will need python version 3.7 which is seen with cp37).
